Unified Health Record Hub (UHRH)

A full-stack healthcare platform designed to centralize electronic patient records and intelligently predict Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD) risk using Machine Learning.
This project integrates backend APIs, a modern frontend dashboard, and an ML-powered predictive engine to support early diagnosis and care delivery.

Project Overview

The Unified Health Record Hub solves a critical issue in healthcare: patient medical information being fragmented across multiple hospitals and systems.
This platform provides a centralized hub where hospitals can digitally store and access patient data, medical history, lab reports, and doctor evaluations with ease.

Alongside EHR management, the system includes a machine learning model trained to predict CKD risk based on clinical parameters, helping doctors make earlier and more accurate decisions.
